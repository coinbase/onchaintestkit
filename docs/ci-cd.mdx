Learn how to integrate OnchainTestKit into your CI/CD pipeline for automated blockchain testing on every commit. The example will likely will be slightly different depending on your project structure.

## GitHub Actions

### Basic Example Setup

Create `.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yml`:

```yaml
name: E2E Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  e2e:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 30

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Set up Corepack + yarn
        run: |
          npm install -g corepack
          yarn set version 4.9.2

      - name: Install root dependencies
        run: yarn

      - name: Install Foundry
        uses: foundry-rs/foundry-toolchain@v1

      - name: Build contracts
        run: |
          cd smart-contracts
          forge install foundry-rs/forge-std
          forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
          forge build

      - name: Install Playwright browsers
        run: yarn playwright install --with-deps

      - name: Prepare wallet extensions
        run: |
          yarn prepare-metamask
          yarn prepare-coinbase

      - name: Build application
        run: |
          echo "E2E_TEST_SEED_PHRASE=${{ secrets.E2E_TEST_SEED_PHRASE }}" > .env
          echo "E2E_CONTRACT_PROJECT_ROOT=../smart-contracts" >> .env
          yarn build

      - name: Install xvfb
        run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y xvfb

      - name: Run E2E tests
        env:
          NODE_OPTIONS: '--dns-result-order=ipv4first'
        run: xvfb-run --auto-servernum --server-args="-screen 0 1920x1080x24" yarn test:e2e
```

## Optimization Tips

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Use headless mode in CI">
Always run headless in CI for better performance:

```typescript
use: {
  headless: !!process.env.CI,
  video: process.env.CI ? 'retain-on-failure' : 'off',
}
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Implement retry logic">
Add smart retry logic for flaky tests:

```typescript
retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:{SOME_PORT}">
This error occurs when Node.js resolves "localhost" to ::1 (IPv6) but Anvil only listens on IPv4 addresses.

**Solution:** Force Node.js to prefer IPv4 addresses by setting the `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable:

```yaml
- name: Run E2E tests
  env:
    NODE_OPTIONS: '--dns-result-order=ipv4first'
  run: xvfb-run --auto-servernum --server-args="-screen 0 1920x1080x24" yarn test:e2e
```

This ensures:
- `localhost` resolves to `127.0.0.1` (IPv4) instead of `::1` (IPv6)
- Anvil can properly listen on the resolved address
- Tests can successfully connect to the local blockchain
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Flaky tests with high parallelism only in CI/CD workflows">
E2E tests may become less reliable with increased parallelism, especially when multiple wallet interactions occur simultaneously. This is 
not an issue locally though.

**Solutions:**
- Reduce test parallelism in CI environments:
  ```typescript
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : 4,
  ```
- Add longer timeouts for wallet operations:
  ```typescript
  timeout: 60_000, // 60 seconds for wallet-heavy tests
  ```
- Use test isolation to prevent state conflicts:
  ```typescript
  testInfo.annotations.push({ type: 'serial' });
  ```
